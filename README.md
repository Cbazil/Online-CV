## Change Log
- Made the Nav bar purple bgcolor, added/imported custom font into the document
- Corrected the GiF image, positioned h1 and h3 and aligned the Fa Fa links just under h2 
- Attached the giF and About section.
- Changed the codepen link & fa fa with freecode camps profile link & fa fa
- Added Mobile view template for better UX and UI
- Instead on moving the h1 and h2 tags along with the fa-fa container section, I just placed a div and will move and ajust everything within in.
- Change gif image with a cropped version.
- Made Headings responsive, Mobile drop down effect is active now.
- Set Grid template and started with my information section.
- Responsiveness nearly complete. (2018/11/23)
